# Human-Resource-SQL-Analysis


## Executive Summary
Between 2010 and 2015, Elvo-Express faced notable fluctuations in its workforce composition. An in-depth analysis of hiring patterns, employee attrition, retention rates, and diversity metrics has revealed valuable insights into the company’s human resource operations during this period. This report explores these findings, uncovers underlying trends, and offers recommendations to enhance staff retention, promote inclusivity, and support strategic workforce planning.

## Analysis Overview
### Hiring and Termination Patterns (2010–2015)

Over the five years under review, Elvo-Express welcomed 6,520 new employees, marking a clear phase of organisational growth. However, this expansion was tempered by 688 terminations, reflecting a considerable churn rate that warrants attention.

A deeper analysis revealed that Ohio experienced the highest number of employee terminations. Given that Ohio also hosts the company’s headquarters and largest workforce hub, this trend is not entirely unexpected. Nonetheless, the churn volume suggests that operational, managerial, or cultural challenges in this location merit further investigation.

On a departmental level, Engineering recorded the highest termination rate. This may indicate role-specific pressures, limited career development opportunities, or departmental leadership issues affecting employee satisfaction. By contrast, the Auditing department had the lowest termination count, suggesting effective employee engagement and a more stable work environment.

From a demographic perspective, White employees experienced the highest termination rates. While this might align with overall workforce composition, it also signals the importance of reviewing HR processes to ensure equitable support systems and unbiased termination practices across all racial groups.

#### Key observations include:

- Ohio had the highest termination numbers.
- Engineering recorded the most employee exits among departments.
- Auditing maintained the lowest termination count.
- White employees represented the majority of terminations demographically.

### Employee Retention and Churn Insights
The analysis also shed light on employee retention patterns within the company. The Marketing department consistently retained the highest percentage of its workforce, hinting at a positive work environment supported by effective leadership, employee growth opportunities, and clearly structured career pathways.

However, not all departments enjoyed such stability. The Business Analyst role saw the highest churn rate across all job titles, suggesting role-specific challenges such as workload imbalance, inadequate remuneration, or a lack of professional development. This high turnover could impact operational consistency and suggests a need for role-specific employee engagement strategies.

**When examining tenure trends:**

- Employees in Research and Development recorded the longest average tenure, likely benefitting from supportive management, engaging projects, or better work-life balance.
- In contrast, Business Development had the shortest employee tenure, a potential indicator of role misalignment, employee dissatisfaction, or leadership challenges that require immediate attention.

#### Highlights:

- The marketing department leads in employee retention.
- The Business Analyst role struggles with the highest turnover.
- Research and Development boasts the longest staff tenure.
- Business Development suffers from the shortest employee tenure.

### Workforce Diversity
Regarding workforce composition, most Elvo-Express employees were White, followed by Black or African American and Asian staff. Although diversity is present, these figures indicate an overrepresentation of certain racial groups and a noticeable underrepresentation of others. This imbalance underscores the need for more proactive recruitment strategies aimed at underrepresented communities.

Gender representation across the company leaned towards 50.8% male and 46.5% female employees, with a minor presence of non-conforming individuals. While this suggests relative gender balance at a macro level, disparities persist at the departmental level, with some teams lacking meaningful gender diversity. This could limit the range of perspectives and innovation within those groups.

#### Notable findings:

- The workforce is predominantly White, followed by Black or African American and Asian.
- Male employees slightly outnumber female staff at 50.8% to 46.5%.
- Minimal representation of non-conforming employees.
- Gender diversity imbalances exist within certain departments.

### Geographical Workforce Distribution
Elvo-Express’ operational model remains heavily centralised, with the majority of its employees based at the Ohio-Cleveland headquarters. Other states such as Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, Wisconsin, and cities like Cincinnati, Dayton, Columbus, and Toledo, hosted significantly smaller remote teams.

While this centralised approach offers certain efficiencies, it also introduces potential risks, including operational bottlenecks and limited market adaptability in underserved regions. Interestingly, the highest employee turnover rates were concentrated in Ohio, aligning with the region’s status as the largest operational hub.

This correlation between workforce concentration and high turnover rates indicates that:

- Large workforce hubs require enhanced HR support structures.
- Welfare initiatives and employee engagement programs should be prioritised in high-density regions.
- Expanding operational capacity in underrepresented locations could help balance staffing pressures and mitigate turnover risks.


## Recommendations
To address the challenges and opportunities identified in this analysis, the following actions are recommended:

- Conduct qualitative exit interviews and engagement surveys, focusing on Ohio and the Engineering department, to uncover root causes behind high turnover.
- Develop targeted retention initiatives for high-risk roles such as Business Analyst, including workload restructuring, compensation reviews, and professional development programs.
- Replicate the best practices of high-retention departments like Marketing by identifying effective leadership styles, employee recognition programs, and growth opportunities.
- Launch diversity-focused recruitment campaigns aimed at increasing representation for underrepresented racial groups and promoting gender balance in departments with existing gaps.
- Strengthen remote employee support programs and consider redistributing operational workloads to reduce overdependence on the Ohio-Cleveland headquarters, enhancing resilience and market responsiveness.

## Conclusion
This comprehensive analysis of Elvo-Express’ workforce dynamics from 2010 to 2015 reveals an organisation in a period of significant operational transition. While expansion efforts successfully increased headcount, challenges related to employee churn, uneven retention patterns, and diversity gaps remain.

By proactively addressing these issues and leveraging the insights outlined in this report, Elvo-Express can enhance employee engagement, foster a more inclusive workplace culture, and build a resilient workforce positioned to support long-term business success.
